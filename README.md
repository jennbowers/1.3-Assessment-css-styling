# README

This assessment tests your basic knowledge of CSS and styling.

Your task is to review index.png and index.html and to write the CSS to match the mockup.

At the end of this project, your HTML file, when rendered in the browser, should closely match the mockup.

## Resources

The resources folder contains the screenshot of the final HTML page.

The source_files folder contains the starter HTML file, the img folder (containing all of the images for the page), and a blank CSS file. The CSS file is already linked up to the HTML file, so you can go ahead and code away with your styles.

### Screen Shots

Screen shot of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work to try and determine if you are on track.

- *index.png* is a screen shot of the rendered HTML after it has been styled with CSS.

### Starter Files

The starter files contains the complete HTML file and a linked style sheet. Work out of this folder, but don't edit the HTML. Your goal is to add styles to the style sheet to match *index.html*.
